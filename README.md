# üöÄ Sechabeng

A **__weird__** solution to automatically do your social media task. This app can do all of your basic need on media social platform such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter (Possible to add more!).
This uses __puppeteer__ to execute the actions. Becareful! If you use VPS and the server location is different than your usual location, you will have a hard time.
